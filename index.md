CSAwesome is an interactive ebook supported by the College Board intending to help students and teachers develop a deeper understanding of programming in Java for the AP Computer Science-A curriculum. This ebook is free to all users, an important step in making education more equitable for all students.

I am a project team member of Tech 4 Social Good at the University of Michigan, which is teaming up with the Lunar Doula Collective in Ann Arbor, MI to create a robust website that will be used by volunteers and community members to support the Lunar Doula Collective's mission to provide compassionate support, free of charge, to individuals experiencing pregnancy loss or termination.
